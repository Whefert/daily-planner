# Work Day Scheduler

## Description

A simple calendar application that allows a user to save events for each hour of the day. This app runs in the browser and features dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by jQuery. The Day.js library is used to work with dates and times.

Here is the link to the deployed application: https://whefert.github.io/daily-planner/

The following animation demonstrates the application functionality:

## Acceptance Criteria

The app:

- Displays the current day at the top of the calender when a user opens the planner.

- Presents timeblocks for standard business hours when the user scrolls down.

- Color-codes each timeblock based on past, present, and future when the timeblock is viewed.

- Allows a user to enter an event when they click a timeblock

- Saves the event in local storage when the save button is clicked in that timeblock.

- Persists events between refreshes of a page

## Installation

## Usage
